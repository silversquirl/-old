_How many of these have I done now? I don't even know._

\- is a text editor. It's written in Tcl and uses the Tk GUI toolkit.

Yes, it uses a GUI, unlike every other text editor I've ever tried to
write. Why? Because Tk is easy. I can write a text editor in 13 lines of
code. Not a very good one, admittedly, but it does work.

At the moment, - doesn't do much. I've got a working editor, but not
much else. It's got a fair way to go before it's usable for code
editing.
